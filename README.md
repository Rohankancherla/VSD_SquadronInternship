# VSD_SquadronInternship
  The VSDSquadron Mini-Internship program is designed to introduce participants to VLSI chip design and RISC-V architecture through open-source tools. It provides a hands-on learning experience using the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board, which serves as the core of the program.

This development board includes a 32-bit RISC-V processor, 16KB of flash memory, and 2KB of SRAM, running at a clock speed of 24MHz. It has 15 GPIO pins for hardware interfacing and supports communication protocols like I2C, SPI, and USART, making it suitable for a variety of projects. The program helps participants understand the RISC-V ecosystem and apply their knowledge by creating and testing hardware applications.

C based
------------------------------------------

Install leafpad editor 

*Use the following command for installing leafpad*
```
sudo apt install leafpad
```
Now we need to write a program in c for sum of 1 to n numbers, and save the file as "sum1ton.c"
