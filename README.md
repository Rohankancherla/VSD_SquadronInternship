# VSD_SquadronInternship
  The VSDSquadron Mini-Internship program is designed to introduce participants to VLSI chip design and RISC-V architecture through open-source tools. It provides a hands-on learning experience using the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V Development Board, which serves as the core of the program.

This development board includes a 32-bit RISC-V processor, 16KB of flash memory, and 2KB of SRAM, running at a clock speed of 24MHz. It has 15 GPIO pins for hardware interfacing and supports communication protocols like I2C, SPI, and USART, making it suitable for a variety of projects. The program helps participants understand the RISC-V ecosystem and apply their knowledge by creating and testing hardware applications.

<summary><b>Task 1:</b> C based program for sum of n numbers</summary>   
<br>

C based
------------------------------------------

Install leafpad editor 

*Use the following command for installing leafpad*
```
sudo apt install leafpad
```
Now we need to write a program in c for sum of 1 to n numbers, and save the file as "sum1ton.c"

![c program sum1ton](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b180bdc1-1a9e-4b64-b215-1f6f199b9d8d)

Now after we compile this and run using the commands :

```
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```
The output of the c code is :

![C sum1ton_output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f78ab9-44da-4f6a-ab16-8caafe2d0a61)

RISC-V based
------------------------------------------

We can view the sum code using the following command :
```
cat sum1ton.c
```
The terminal output of the above the commad :
